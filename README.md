# aws-labs
A collection of security focused labs for AWS.
Labs 1-3 are deep dives into AWS IAM.

Follow the Readme for each lab.
If there are any issues, we recommend running from the docker container provided.
This is intermediate level and assumes some familiarity with AWS. 
In Lab 1, we start with basic cli and bash.
Lab 2 we move to a jupyter notebook for the exercises.
